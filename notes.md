# notes

## Path

* added rtools to path
* added ssc.dll to path

## makevars

* added the `.h` file directory to the cpp flags
* added the dll path to pkg libs

## roxygen2

* should be using roxygen2. Dealing with namespace file was annoying at first.
* need to `//'@export` these cpp functions that are callable from R.
